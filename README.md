# CPD/CE Concierge + Audit-Ready Tracker

> **CPD/CE compliance, done-for-you.** Plan + tracking + audit pack set up in 24 hours.

---

## Blueprint Overview

This project replicates the "$119 to type npm install" playbook for the CPD/CE (Continuing Professional Development / Continuing Education) market in financial adviser services. The model: hype → remove friction → simple landing page → paid search → white-glove fulfillment.

---

## 1. The Direct Analogue: "$119 to type npm install" in Adviser CPD

In CPD/CE, the real friction isn't learning  - it's:

- Figuring out which requirements apply (credential + state/country + role)
- Picking approved activities
- Tracking evidence / certificates
- Reporting in the right place
- Being audit-ready at the deadline

**The wedge offer:**

> "We set up your entire CPD/CE compliance system and plan  - done-for-you. You just complete the learning."

Same psychological trade:
- **DIY exists** (free, confusing, time-intensive)
- **Paid offer** removes anxiety + setup + admin

### Hype Waves to Ride

Trigger events that create urgency and lots of "how do I…" searches:

| Market | Trigger Event | Details |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **US (CFP)** | CFP Board approved future increase to 40 CE hours per two-year cycle | Effective Q1 2027, plus carryover changes, practice management allowance, etc. Perfect "deadline + confusion" fuel. |
| **US (IAR)** | NASAA publishes state adoption list with effective dates | e.g., Illinois effective 1/1/2026 |
| **UK** | FCA requires 35 hours CPD annually | 21 structured (for retail investment activities) |

Build region/credential-specific funnels  - mirror the "hype wave" everyone is already discussing.

## 2. The Product: Full Feature Set

### Product Promise (The Headline)

**"CPD/CE, planned and audit-ready in 24 hours. No spreadsheets. No portals. No guesswork."**

### Core Product Modules

#### A) Requirements & Profile Engine (The "Wizard")

- Credential selection (CFP / RIA / IAR / insurance / etc.) and jurisdiction(s)
- Renewal deadlines + reporting periods (per credential/jurisdiction)
- Category constraints (ethics, structured/unstructured, firm element, etc.)
- "Your CPD gap" calculation: required vs completed
- 1-page compliance brief (PDF + dashboard view)

> This is the "non-technical user" moment: they don't want rules, they want a plan.

#### B) Done-for-You Setup (The "npm install" Equivalent)

What the team does after purchase:

- Create their CPD dashboard (account provisioning)
- Build their personalized CPD plan (calendar + course list)
- Set up reminders (email + calendar)
- Create an "audit binder" folder structure (cloud drive vault)
- Configure reporting workflow (who submits what, where, when)

**Deliverable:** "Your CPD system is live" email with:
- Dashboard link
- Plan calendar link
- "Next action" (one single next step)

#### C) Course/Content Layer (Revenue Scale)

Two options:

| Approach | Speed | Margin | Details |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Option 1: Partner/affiliate/resell** | Fastest | Lower | Wrap concierge + tracking around existing accredited providers |
| **Option 2: Become accredited provider** | Slower | Higher | Publish your own modules |

Platform features either way:
- Micro-modules (10–20 min)
- Live webinars (scheduled)
- Assessments where required
- Certificate issuance and storage

#### D) Tracking + Evidence Vault (Audit-Grade)

- Auto logging of completed modules (from platform/partners)
- Manual logging for external activities (with evidence upload)
- Structured vs unstructured tagging (esp. UK)
- Certificate vault with:
  - File naming conventions
  - Metadata (date, duration, learning outcome)
  - Exportable audit report (PDF/CSV)

#### E) Reporting / Submission Support

- "One-click export" reports for adviser and/or compliance manager
- Submission checklist (credential-specific)
- Optional concierge submission assistance (where allowed)
- Deadline countdown and escalation reminders

#### F) Firm / Team Dashboard (B2B Multiplier)

For RIAs, practices, networks:
- Seat management (users, roles)
- Compliance admin dashboard
- Completion status by adviser
- Audit report packs per adviser
- Policy templates + CPD policy acknowledgment tracking

#### G) Support & "CPD Helpdesk"

This is where conversion happens (people pay to avoid confusion):
- "Ask a human" CPD concierge (chat/email)
- Knowledge base: "What counts?" "How to log?" "Structured vs unstructured?"
- Office hours (group Q&A)

#### H) Guardrails (Critical)

Must be explicit:
- **You do not complete coursework or assessments for advisers**
- **You do not falsify logs**
- **You provide admin support, planning, tracking, and audit packaging**

This keeps you safe and builds trust (and avoids reputational death).

## 6. How to Rank in ChatGPT Search and Google

### A) Ranking in ChatGPT Search

OpenAI is explicit: ranking is based on multiple factors for "reliable, relevant information"  - no guaranteed top placement.

**Action Checklist:**

1. In `robots.txt`, allow:
   ```
   User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
   Allow: /
   ```
2. If using a CDN/WAF, allow OpenAI's published IP ranges for OAI-SearchBot
3. Ensure pages are publicly accessible (no hard paywalls for core content)

**Be a source ChatGPT wants to cite:**
- Publish direct answers to high-intent questions ("What are the CE changes effective 2027?", "How to stay audit ready?")
- Include clear definitions and step-by-step checklists
- Keep pages updated (AI search penalizes stale content in practice)

> Note: ChatGPT Search may partner with third-party search providers (Bing, Shopify). Classic SEO still matters because upstream indexes feed the pipeline.

### B) Ranking in Google (and AI Overviews / AI Mode)

Google guidance: no special optimizations required beyond strong SEO fundamentals.

**Action Plan:**

#### 1. Build "Topic Clusters" Around High-Intent Searches

| Hub Page | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `/cfp-ce/` | Requirements, timelines, FAQs, calculator |
| `/iar-ce/` | State adoption, what counts, how to log |
| `/uk-adviser-cpd/` | Structured vs unstructured, audit trail |

#### 2. Add "Tools" That Attract Links and Citations

LLMs + Google both love pages that are uniquely useful:
- CE/CPD "hours remaining" calculator
- Downloadable audit checklist
- CPD policy template for firms
- "Deadline calendar" by credential

#### 3. Make Content Citeable

- Put the answer near the top (TL;DR + bullets)
- Use headings that match user questions verbatim
- Add a short FAQ
- Provide dates, definitions, summary boxes ("Effective Q1 2027…")

#### 4. Authority Building

- Guest posts on adviser industry sites
- Partnerships with compliance consultants
- Appear in "approved provider" directories if accredited
- Publish a small annual report (e.g., "State of Adviser CPD/CE 2026")

#### 5. Technical Hygiene

- Fast pages, minimal JS blocking
- Schema where appropriate (FAQ, Organization, Course/Event)
- Keep structured data consistent with on-page text

---

## 7. Domain Name Shortlist

### Naming Rules

- Avoid ambiguity: CPD vs CE (US vs UK/AU). If multi-region, consider "CPD" as brand, with "CE" pages.
- Avoid trademark magnets ("Copilot" = risky given Microsoft branding)
- Prefer .com; otherwise .co / .io / .education
- Pick something you can say on a podcast without spelling it twice

### Shortlist

**More Descriptive:**
- AuditReadyCPD.com
- CPDAuditPack.com
- AdvisorCPDHub.com
- CEforAdviserPros.com
- CPDCompliance.com

**More Brandable:**
- CPDVault.com
- CPDDesk.com
- CEBrief.com
- CPDSignals.com
- TrackMyCPD.com

### Recommendation

For "done-for-you" positioning:
- **AuditReadyCPD.com**  - best if CPD-first, UK/AU-forward
- **AuditReadyCE.com**  - best if US-first

Synonyms if taken:
- ProofReadyCPD.com
- CPDProof.com
- CPDReady.com

> Verify availability with a registrar + trademark check before committing.

## 8. 14-Day Launch Plan

| Days | Actions |
|------|---------|
| **1–2** | Choose 1 primary wedge: (CFP CE changes) OR (IAR CE state adoption) OR (UK adviser CPD). Build 1 landing page + checkout + onboarding form. |
| **3–5** | Create 5 "answer pages" targeting most-searched questions (800–1500 words each, updated dates, FAQ). Implement `robots.txt` allowing OAI-SearchBot. Ensure CDN access. |
| **6–7** | Launch Google Search ads (exact + phrase match), 10–20 keywords total, tight negatives. Retargeting pixel + 3 retargeting creatives. |
| **8–14** | Refine ads based on search terms report. Add 2 more landing pages for adjacent segments. Publish 3 more answer pages. Start partner outreach to compliance consultants / newsletters. |

---

## Compliance Note

CPD/CE sits adjacent to licensing and regulatory obligations. The product is explicitly about:

- **Planning**
- **Tracking**
- **Evidence management**
- **Reminders**
- **Reporting support**

...and **not** "we'll do your CE for you."

That keeps you on the right side of ethics and makes your brand durable.

## 9. UK Market Participants: What They Publish as CPD

The pattern is consistent: **free/low-friction content + structured CPD proof (certificate) + light gating + brand affinity + pipeline**.

| Provider | Content Format | CPD Mechanism | Key UX Pattern |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Aviva** | Webinar hub with CPD minutes + learning outcomes | Attendance tracked as CPD minutes | Non-scary UI: outcomes + minutes + "watch now" |
| **Legal & General** | CPD Academy: frequent webinars/workshops | CII-accredited structured CPD | Positioned as "advice process improvement", not product training |
| **Zurich** | Learning Hub: short videos, live/on-demand webinars | Personalised certificates; stored in personal CPD file | "CPD file" = retention flywheel |
| **Royal London** | CPD modules + webinars (pensions/investment/protection) | Certificate unlocked via short quiz | Quiz = stronger "verifiable" CPD signal |
| **Aberdeen** | Free online CPD modules with outcomes | CII/PFS-accredited modules | "Translate detail into what it means for you and your clients" |
| **M&G Wealth** | Technical sessions with learning outcomes | CPD certificate claimed via form | Certificate claiming = lead capture + compliance moment |
| **Quilter Cheviot** | Adviser guides with CPD questionnaire | Certificate sent after questionnaire | Article -> assessment -> certificate (high leverage) |
| **Canada Life** | Academy: live/on-demand webinars + technical library | Personalised certificates | Academy + library = non-webinar assets keep CPD narrative |
| **Aegon** | CPD hub: webinars + CPD Hub library | "Complete questions, collect certificate" | Direct tie to structured CPD goals |
| **Scottish Widows** | Webinar series | Separate certificate request form | Split "watch" and "request certificate" reduces friction |
| **LV=** | Protection webinar calendar | Certificate per session | Calendar-first navigation = retention mechanic |
| **Morningstar** | On-demand adviser webinars | Quiz completion -> certificate emailed | On-demand + quiz = scalable (no scheduling pressure) |

### What They're Really Doing

1. **Publishing frequent, low-cost "education" content** that doubles as marketing
2. **Converting consumption into structured/verifiable CPD proof** via accreditation, quizzes, certificates
3. **Using CPD as a distribution channel**: registrations, reminders, certificate forms, and "CPD vaults" = owned audience engine

### Their Source Material Stack

| Layer | Examples |
|-------|---------|
| **Regulatory & compliance** | FCA 35h/year (21 structured), insurance distribution CPD, vulnerable customers |
| **Technical / product mechanics** | Tax year-end, pensions, investment, protection explainers |
| **Market / behavioural insight** | Intergenerational wealth, financial wellbeing, market updates |
| **Sales & practice management** | Advice process improvement, sales techniques (still CPD-framed) |

---

## 10. Replication Capability Checklist

### 1) Content Production Engine (Weekly Cadence)

- Editorial calendar by topic cluster (regulation, technical, client segments, practice management)
- SMEs (technical specialists, compliance, product, external guests)
- Standard template per asset:
  - Learning objectives/outcomes
  - Duration/minutes
  - Audience level (intro/intermediate/advanced)
  - "What changed / why it matters / what to do next"

### 2) "Proof" Engine (Turn Content into Structured/Verifiable CPD)

- Automated **certificate generator** (name, date, duration, outcomes, provider identity)
- **Assessment mechanic** (quiz or attestation)
- **Audit trail**: completion logs + certificate storage ("CPD file/vault" pattern)
- Optional: external accreditation relationships (CII / CISI in adviser context)

### 3) Distribution Engine

- Email list growth loops: register for webinar, claim certificate, download guide + CPD questionnaire
- Retention loops: "new CPD module this week", "you're X hours short", "export your CPD pack"

### 4) Governance

- Content QA and compliance sign-off
- Clear separation: **education vs promotion**
- Retention policy for certificates and logs (audit readiness)

## 12. Market Participant Analysis: AUS / CAN / USA

### Australia (FASEA/ASIC)

**Regulatory landscape:** Australian financial advisers must complete 40 hours CPD annually under the ASIC standards (formerly FASEA). Activities must span four knowledge areas: technical competence, client care, regulatory compliance, and professionalism/ethics. The market is underserved by purpose-built CPD tracking tools - most advisers use spreadsheets or licensee-provided portals with limited audit-readiness features.

**Key participants:**
- **Kaplan Professional** - dominant CPD provider for financial planners, accredited modules
- **ASIC / Treasury** - regulator publishing CPD standards and guidance
- **FPA (Financial Planning Association)** - industry body, CPD events and resources
- **Licensee groups** (AMP, IOOF, Insignia) - internal CPD tracking for their adviser networks

**Opportunity:** Independent advisers (growing rapidly post-Royal Commission) lack enterprise CPD tools. The 40h/year requirement with four mandatory knowledge areas creates genuine tracking complexity.

### Canada (FP Canada)

**Regulatory landscape:** FP Canada CFP certificants need 25 CE credits/year with at least 1 in Professional Responsibility. QAFP certificants need 12 credits/year. The market is fragmented across provinces with additional provincial licensing requirements on top of FP Canada.

**Key participants:**
- **FP Canada** - certification body, publishes CE requirements
- **CSI (Canadian Securities Institute)** - major CE provider
- **IFSE Institute** - CE courses for investment fund industry
- **Provincial regulators** (OSC, AMF, BCSC) - additional licensing CE

**Opportunity:** The dual-credential complexity (national FP Canada + provincial securities licensing) creates confusion. A unified tracker covering both would be highly valued.

### United States (CFP Board / NASAA / FINRA)

**Regulatory landscape:** The US market has three overlapping CE frameworks:
1. **CFP Board**: 30h per 2-year cycle (increasing to 40h from Q1 2027), 2h ethics
2. **NASAA (IAR)**: 12h/year (6h ethics + 6h products), state-by-state adoption
3. **FINRA**: Regulatory Element (content-based, annual) + Firm Element (firm-defined)

**Key participants:**
- **CFP Board** - certification body, CE requirements and approved provider directory
- **Kitces.com** - dominant CE content provider for financial planners
- **Morningstar** - CE webinars and on-demand content
- **NASAA** - IAR CE requirements, state adoption tracking
- **Kaplan Financial Education** - CE courses across credentials
- **CFFP / National Endowment** - CE events and conferences

**Opportunity:** The CFP 40-hour increase (Q1 2027) is the largest addressable "hype wave" - every CFP needs 33% more CE hours. Combined with the IAR state-by-state rollout creating confusion about which states require what, the US market has the highest intent search volume and the most confusion to resolve.

### Compliance Substrate (Cross-Market)

All three markets share common compliance infrastructure needs:
- **Evidence vault** with naming conventions, metadata, and export-ready reports
- **Category tagging** (ethics, structured/unstructured, verifiable/non-verifiable)
- **Deadline management** with escalation reminders
- **Audit-ready exports** in credential-specific formats
- **Multi-credential support** (many advisers hold 2-3 overlapping credentials)

The AuditReadyCPD platform addresses all of these with a unified data model that maps credential-specific rules to a common tracking and reporting interface.

## 13. Market Participant CPD Research: What Providers Actually Do

### Financial Services CPD from Market Participants (Insurers, Platforms, Asset Managers)

These organisations use CPD as (a) adviser education and (b) lead-gen / relationship marketing. The patterns are consistent across the industry:

| Provider | Model | Key Pattern |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Aviva** | Webinar hub with CPD minutes + "watch now" on-demand | Interactive Q&A sessions; links to technical articles for more CPD |
| **Legal & General** | CPD Academy with CII-accredited webinars/workshops | Table format: title, CPD mins, link |
| **Zurich** | Gated "Learning Hub" with on-demand + bite-sized resources | Automatic certificate creation + storage in personal CPD file; watch-time/quiz criteria; Okta/Unipass identity |
| **Royal London** | Mandated e-learning + self-directed learning mix | Automatic tracking for mandatory; flexible logging for self-directed; references FCA CPD expectations |
| **abrdn** | Accredited modules completable in parts | Certificate emailed after completing questions |
| **M&G** | Structured CPD sessions (CISI + CII accredited) | "Send certificate" workflow including reflective statements |
| **Quilter Cheviot** | "Watch + questionnaire + request certificate" model | Certificate sent after completing survey |
| **Canada Life** | Live webinars + on-demand with personalised certificates | Structured CPD certificates + encouragement to self-log unstructured activity |
| **Aegon** | "Watch content + answer questions" model | CPD certificate on quiz completion |
| **Scottish Widows** | Expert series on YouTube | "Request CPD certificate" pattern with stated learning objectives |
| **LV=** | Webinar calendar | Certificate received after sessions |
| **Morningstar** | Complete quiz per webinar, certificate emailed | Learning objectives + CPD credit hours per listing; access gated via lead form |

**Best-in-class:** The more mature implementations behave like mini-learning platforms with automatic tracking + certificate vault + clear completion criteria (e.g., Zurich).

**Common gap even in good ones:** Fragmentation - the webinar might be ON24/Zoom/YouTube, the certificate somewhere else, and the user's real CPD record still lives in yet another system/spreadsheet.

### AUS, CAN, USA Provider Examples

| Provider | Region | Model | Notable Feature |
|----------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **TAL** | AU | 40+ on-demand courses, FAAA-accredited | Built-in CPD tracker, mobile access, tests/results, course certificates |
| **Macquarie Group** | AU | On-demand webinar catalogue (YouTube + live registration) | Education content but not "CPD-native" without tracking/certification wrapper |
| **Financial Education Professionals** | AU | LMS/productised approach with tracking/reporting | Short-course assessment via online MCQ exam; fulfilment friction (orders processed, login sent later) |
| **Sun Life** | CA | CE webinar series with mandatory quizzes | Up to 2 CE credits per session; credits available even via recordings (with quiz completion) |
| **Nationwide** | US | Webinars granting state insurance + designation credit | State complexity: approvals vary by state (e.g., "not approved in NJ, OK, VA, WA") |

### Professional-Body / Profession-Led CPD Tracking

A key structural fact across industries: content is decentralised, but the burden of proof sits with the professional (and/or their employer), often with audit risk.

| Organisation | Pattern |
|-------------|---------|
| **IET (Engineering)** | "Career Manager" to plan/record/declare CPD; members may be asked to provide proof annually |
| **Engineers Australia** | Portal to record CPD |
| **SRA (Solicitors)** | Templates to record learning/development; may require evidence through training record reviews |
| **AICPA & CIMA** | "My Learning Tracker" pattern for CPE (certificates + transcripts) |
| **BMJ (Healthcare)** | Dashboard keeping record of activity; download certificates |
| **AMA (American Medical)** | Transcript app to access transcripts/certificates; removes manual admin |
| **RACP (Royal Australasian College of Physicians)** | MyCPD platform for recording activities and tracking progress |
| **CPD Home** | Automatic tracking for subscribers; catalogue + option to host accredited activities or link to provider platforms |

---

## 14. Common Building Blocks and Provider Spend Analysis

### Universal Functional Building Blocks

Nearly every provider implements these components:

1. **Catalogue of activities** (webinars, modules, articles)
2. **Completion criteria** (watch-time, attendance, quiz, reflection)
3. **Certificate issuance** (PDF/email/download)
4. **Transcript / CPD log** (often manual, sometimes inside the provider platform)
5. **Accreditation metadata** (learning objectives, hours/points, category)
6. **Identity + access control** (sometimes strict "professionals only")
7. **Analytics + marketing** (registration, attendance, conversion)

### Where Providers Spend Money Today

Provider spend falls into five buckets:

| Bucket | What It Covers |
|--------|---------------|
| **Content production & SMEs** | Presenter time, policy/technical authors, slide design, editing, post-production |
| **Accreditation + compliance ops** | Staff time to prepare submissions, track approvals/expiry, store evidence, handle audit queries |
| **Delivery tooling** | Webinar platforms (attendance reporting), video hosting, quizzes/surveys, certificate generation, email automation |
| **Web/LMS engineering** | Maintaining multiple microsites, content pages, tables, search/tagging, login/SSO, data retention |
| **Support + admin** | "Where's my certificate?", login problems, manual certificate fulfilment, spreadsheet tracking |

### What Providers Want to Centralise (Without Losing Their Brand)

- Course creation templates + metadata
- Quizzes/reflection + completion rules
- Certificates + transcript storage
- Jurisdiction rules (hours/points/categories/state approvals)
- Reporting (for audits, internal compliance, sponsor ROI)
- Integrations (CRM + webinar + identity)

---

## 15. Observable Gaps and Improvement Opportunities

### For the Learner (Time-Saving)

1. **One CPD wallet, not 12:** certificates are emailed, stored in random portals, or must be requested manually
2. **Search and filtering that respects real constraints:** by jurisdiction, structured vs unstructured, ethics vs technical, time available (15/30/60 mins)
3. **Remove repetitive forms:** many providers gate every asset separately
4. **Portable transcript:** professionals need exportable evidence packs for audits

### For the Provider (Maintenance + Cost-Saving)

1. **Stop running CPD on spreadsheets + SurveyMonkey + inbox rules** - operationally expensive and fragile
2. **Automate credit eligibility logic** - watch-time/quiz thresholds, state/province restrictions, structured/unstructured rules; US state-by-state approvals are the clearest case
3. **Reduce platform sprawl** - ON24/Zoom/GoToWebinar + YouTube/Vimeo + LMS + website CMS + CRM + certificate tool = expensive integrations and unclear attribution
4. **Make accreditation reusable** - learning objectives, templates, assessment types, and evidence outputs are highly repeatable yet most organisations recreate them each time

---

## 16. Platform Unification Architecture

The winning architecture is **multi-tenant + modular**:

### A) Provider Console (White-Label CPD/CE "Ops")

**Core modules:**

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Course builder** | Templates for webinar, e-learning, article, podcast |
| **Accreditation pack generator** | Learning objectives, competency mapping, assessment plan, evidence artifacts |
| **Completion rules engine** | Watch-time, quiz pass mark, reflection required, attendance roll-call |
| **Certificate engine** | Branded PDFs + verifiable IDs/QR codes + re-download forever |
| **Content ingestion** | Connect ON24/Zoom/GoToWebinar/YouTube/Vimeo + upload SCORM/xAPI |
| **Reporting** | Completions, drop-off, credit issued, audit trails, export for compliance |
| **CRM integration** | Push registration/completion events to Salesforce/HubSpot/Marketo |
| **Support minimisation** | Self-serve certificate retrieval + "why didn't I qualify?" explanations based on rules |

**Why providers keep maximum benefit:** They still get brand, first-party data, lead capture, topic ownership, compliance oversight, analytics. The platform removes tool sprawl, manual fulfilment, bespoke dev and brittle workflows.

### B) Learner Wallet

- Single transcript across all participating providers
- Auto-log CPD/CE from completions
- Evidence vault (certificates, reflections, attendance records)
- Rule-aware progress tracker (per profession + per country + per state/province)
- Export pack for audits / renewals / employer compliance

### C) Rules Engine ("Compliance Packs" per Profession & Jurisdiction)

Requirements packaged as configurable logic, not custom code:

| Profession | Key Rules |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Financial advisers** | Hours, structured/unstructured, ethics categories, evidence retention |
| **Health** | Credit types, cycle dates, accredited providers, certificates/transcripts |
| **Engineers** | Audit readiness, CPD record formats, evidence uploads |
| **Legal** | Reflection templates + record reviews + evidence on request |
| **Chartered/accounting** | CPE hour totals, transcript downloads, certificate retention |
| **US-specific** | Each state as a ruleset (approval lists, exemptions, course IDs, reporting formats) |

---

## 17. USPs to Win Over Existing CPD/CE Providers

Positioned to hit **maintenance cost, time, and risk** (the three levers providers feel immediately):

| # | USP | What It Replaces |
|---|-----|-----------------|
| 1 | **Replace 6 tools with 1 CPD operating system** | Unify webinar delivery, quizzes, certificates, transcripts, reporting, and catalogue management (still letting them keep Zoom/ON24/YouTube if they want) |
| 2 | **Instant certificates + zero "where's my cert" tickets** | Automatic issuance + permanent re-download in a branded portal; eliminates manual request flows |
| 3 | **Jurisdiction-aware CE automation** | One course configured once, then issued correctly for UK CPD / AU CPD / CA CE / US state-by-state; this is where pricing power lives because it's hard and expensive to do internally |
| 4 | **Audit-proof evidence vault** | Store completion criteria, timestamps, quiz results, reflection statements, certificates, and exportable packs; aligns with how engineering and legal regulators talk about records and evidence |
| 5 | **Accreditation submission packs in 1 click** | Templates for learning objectives, assessment methods, evidence outputs, renewal reminders, and expiry tracking |
| 6 | **White-label by default, marketplace optional** | Default: provider keeps their own branded academy. Optional: list content into shared catalogue for incremental learner acquisition |
| 7 | **Content ingestion, not content migration** | Connect to existing libraries (ON24 recordings, YouTube playlists, LMS modules) and wrap with CPD logic + certification without re-hosting |
| 8 | **Better economics than paid search** | Discovery layer + SEO-ready public course pages lower cost-per-registration over time |

---

## 18. Domain Recommendation (Brand + Cross-Country Clarity)

### Requirements

The name must work across terminology:
- UK/AU: "CPD"
- US/CA: "CE" / "CPE"
- Everyone: "credits", "transcript", "certificate", "wallet", "record"

**Criteria:** Prefer .com, 2-3 syllables max, spellable over the phone, avoid narrow vertical terms, avoid "academy" (overused), should work if expanding beyond CPD/CE.

### Expanded Shortlist

| Domain | Positioning |
|--------|------------|
| **CreditVault.com** (or CredVault.com) | Secure storage of credits + proof |
| **MyCPDWallet.com** / **CPDWallet.com** | Extremely literal (strong early-stage) |
| **CECompass.com** | "Find the right CE fast" |
| **TranscriptHub.com** | Aligns with what professionals actually need |
| **CertRecord.com** | Certificates + records (simple and cross-vertical) |
| **ProCredits.com** | Broad, professional |
| **LearnLedger.com** | "Ledger" evokes auditability (good for regulated professions) |

### Recommendation

**CreditVault** is the strongest cross-country umbrella because it doesn't force CPD vs CE wording, but still signals the job-to-be-done (store and prove credits).

If leaning provider-first ("platform/academy" positioning): **AuditReadyCPD.com** remains strong.
If leaning learner-first ("wallet/transcript" positioning): **CreditVault.com** or **CPDWallet.com**.

## 19. Browser Plugin Architecture

### Overview

A Chrome/Firefox browser extension that shares the webapp's backend, theming, and business logic. The plugin intercepts CPD/CE content on provider websites and offers one-click logging, certificate capture, and progress tracking without leaving the provider's page.

### Shared Codebase Strategy

```
continuing_professional_development/
  webapp/              # Next.js webapp (existing)
  plugin/              # Browser extension (new)
  shared/              # Shared code between webapp and plugin
    src/
      types/           # TypeScript interfaces (credentials, records, evidence)
      rules/           # Credential rules engine (extracted from webapp)
      theme/           # Design tokens, colour palette, typography
      api-client/      # Typed API client for backend endpoints
      utils/           # Shared utilities (hours calc, gap analysis, date helpers)
    tests/             # Cross-project business logic tests
```

### Plugin Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **CPD Activity Detection** | Recognise CPD content on provider pages (webinar completions, quiz results, certificate links) |
| **One-Click Log** | Log CPD hours from provider pages directly to the user's account |
| **Certificate Capture** | Save/screenshot certificates and auto-upload to evidence vault |
| **Progress Sidebar** | Pop-out panel showing current progress, hours remaining, deadline countdown |
| **Quick Search** | Search approved CPD activities by credential and category |
| **Reminder Badges** | Badge icon showing days until deadline / hours remaining |

### Shared Test Strategy

```
shared/tests/
  business-rules.test.ts    # Credential rules, gap analysis, hours calc
  api-contract.test.ts      # API request/response shape validation
  theme.test.ts             # Design token consistency checks

webapp/src/__tests__/
  business-features.test.ts # Existing 108 tests (webapp integration)

plugin/tests/
  popup.test.ts             # Extension popup UI tests
  content-script.test.ts    # Content script detection tests
  background.test.ts        # Service worker / background script tests
  integration.test.ts       # Plugin-to-backend integration tests
```

All three test suites share the same credential rules, API contract shapes, and business logic assertions. The shared tests in `shared/tests/` are imported by both the webapp and plugin test suites.

### Backend Sharing

The plugin authenticates via the same NextAuth.js session (cookie-based for same-origin, or JWT token for cross-origin). API endpoints are shared:

- `GET /api/dashboard` - progress data for sidebar
- `POST /api/cpd-records` - log activity from provider page
- `POST /api/evidence` - upload captured certificate
- `GET /api/reminders` - badge count data
- `GET /api/export/compliance-brief` - quick PDF download

## 20. Next Feature Sprint: Provider Integration MVP

Based on the market research, the next highest-value features to implement:

### Sprint 1: Certificate Engine + Quiz Mechanic

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Certificate PDF generator** (branded, with QR verification) | P0 | Every provider needs this; eliminates "where's my cert" tickets |
| **Quiz/assessment engine** (configurable pass marks, retry logic) | P0 | Required for "verifiable" CPD proof; used by every major provider |
| **Completion rules engine** (watch-time, quiz pass, attendance) | P0 | Automates the manual "did they qualify?" decision |
| **Certificate vault** (permanent re-download, search, export) | P1 | Zurich's best-in-class pattern; major retention flywheel |

### Sprint 2: Content Ingestion + Provider Console

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Content model** (modules, webinars, articles with CPD metadata) | P0 | Foundation for all content features |
| **YouTube/Vimeo ingestion** (wrap existing content with CPD logic) | P1 | USP 7: "content ingestion, not migration" |
| **Webinar platform connectors** (ON24, Zoom attendance data) | P1 | Reduces provider platform sprawl |
| **Provider admin console** (course builder, accreditation packs) | P2 | White-label ops for B2B tier |

### Sprint 3: US State-by-State Automation

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|

## Next Steps

To narrow this into execution-ready materials, decide:

1. **Which market first?** (US CFP/IAR vs UK FCA vs AU)
2. **Option 1 or 2 for content?** (Partner/affiliate vs own accreditation)
3. **Domain name** (verify availability, register)

From there: single best wedge offer → 3 exact landing page variants → keyword list + ad copy pack → launch.
